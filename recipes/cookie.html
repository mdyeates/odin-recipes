    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep.</strong> Preheat oven to 350º F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Whisk dry ingredients.</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and cornstarch until well combined. Set aside. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients.</strong> In a separate large bowl, using a stand mixer or hand mixer on medium speed, cream together the softened butter and the sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure that the butter and sugar are well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla to the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Mix until well combined, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix wet and dry.</strong> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat on a low speed until smooth and creamy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add the chocolate chips.</strong> Fold in the chocolate chips or chocolate chunks with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake.</strong> Scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing to allow room for the cookies to lightly spread as they bake. Bake for 8 – 10 minutes, until the edges are slightly cripsy, the cookie is overall lightly golden brown, and the center is set but not overcooked. Sprinkle the cookies with a pinch of sea salt while they are still warm. Allow them to cool slightly on the baking sheet, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve and / or Store.</strong> Serve the cookies while they are warm and gooey or store for late enjoyment. To store, transfer them to an airtight container and store on the counter for 3 days or in the freezer (in a freezer-safe container) for up to 3 months. To thaw, remove from the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter.
            </li>
        </ol>
